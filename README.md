# Formula-1 Driver-Comparison Dashboard
This repository contains an interactive data visualization built for a university assignment. The project uses D3.js to display driver performance metrics through a dynamic dashboard, allowing users to compare drivers and explore insights interactively.

### AI Usage Disclosure
Generative AI (ChatGPT) was used as a supportive tool during the development of this assignment. The tool was used to clarify D3.js concepts, help generate code snippets (especially to implement more advanced functions, such as update patterns, transitions, and dynamic data binding), assist in debugging, refine interaction logic, and provide suggestions for structuring more advanced functions within the visualization.

Although AI contributed significantly to the development process, all code was reviewed, verified, and adapted by me, ensuring that every function works correctly within the context of the dataset, the project requirements, and the overall design of the visualization.
